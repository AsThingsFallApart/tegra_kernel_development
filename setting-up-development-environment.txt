# Setting up development environment

Requirements
====================================
- clangd


Procedure
====================================
	a. run "cp ./.clangd Linux_for_Tegra/sources/kernel/kernel-jammy-src/"

		i. this file tells clang to ignore certain problematic gcc flags
		ii. this file belongs in the root directory of the kernel


	b. run "cd Linux_for_Tegra/source/"

		i. this command goes to the parent directory of all libraries involved in compiling possible kernels for the Jetson Linux operating system

	
	c. run "ARCH=arm64 CROSS_COMPILE=~/l4t-gcc/bin/aarch64-buildroot-linux-gnu- -C kernel/"

		i. this command makes the default Linux kernel cross-compiled for the Jetson's architecture: aarch64 (a.k.a. "arm64")

	
	d. run "cd kernel/kernel-jammy-src"

		i. this command changes directory to the kernel that was just made called "kernel-jammy-src"

	
	e. run "./scripts/clang-tools/gen_compile_commands.py"

		i. this python script generates the clang compilation commands for every .c source file recursively


	f. done: use favorite text editor to edit kernel source files with language server protocol capabilities
